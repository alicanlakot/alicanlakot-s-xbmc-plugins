Furk.net is a free file hosting with one special feature - a BitTorrent proxy. 
You can use Furk.net as a remote fully automatated BitTorrent client. Torrents can be added by .torrent files, links to them, info_hashes or even RSS feeds such as EZTV. When torrent is ready - you get direct http links and files are added into listing in this plugin. If you use RSS feeds everything is fully automated for you.

Furk.net has developed extended content verification. For every video torrent you get 9 screenshots (thumbnails and full-size), 2 audio samples for each audio stream, detailed codec info and antivirus check (by Kaspersky). Fakes are contantly detected by various filters and either are removed or marked with a warning.
